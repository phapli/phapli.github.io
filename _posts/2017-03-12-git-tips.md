This is some tips about git I want to note for you and me.


## Add .gitignore to existed repo
First commit any outstanding code changes, and then, run this command:
```bash
git rm -r --cached .
```

This removes everything from theindex, then just run:
```bash
git add .
```
Commit it:
```bash
git commit -m ".gitignore is now working"
```

_Note: You can also remove individual files, if you don't want such a drastic approach:_

```bash
git rm --cached filename
```
